# Spring Boot + ButterCMS Starter Project

This Spring Boot starter project fully integrates with dynamic sample content from your ButterCMS account, 
including main menu, pages, blog posts, categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented search functionality.
All of the included sample content is automatically created in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.

[View our live demo hosted at Heroku](https://spring-starter-buttercms.herokuapp.com/), or you can click a button below
to deploy your own copy of our starter project to the provider of your  choice.
